# CivicSpeed Project Template

## 🎯 Purpose
This template provides a standardized project structure for AI-accelerated government digital transformation projects using the CivicSpeed methodology. Achieve 60-75% faster discovery and strategy development while ensuring government compliance and stakeholder alignment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Project
1. **Click "Use this template"** button above
2. **Name your repository:** `CivicSpeed-[ClientName]-[Year]`
   - Examples: `CivicSpeed-Denver-Parks-2024`, `CivicSpeed-County-Clerk-2024`
3. **Clone locally:** `git clone [your-new-repo-url]`

### 2. Customize for Your Project
1. **Replace placeholders** throughout files:
   - `[AGENCY_NAME]` → Your government agency name
   - `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Your specific project name
   - `[STAKEHOLDER_TITLES]` → Actual stakeholder titles
   - `[COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS]` → Agency-specific requirements

2. **Customize service implementations:**
   - Navigate to `02_Phase2_Design/weeks5-6-core-services/service-implementations/`
   - Rename `service-1-template/` to actual services (e.g., `building-permits/`)

### 3. Begin Implementation
1. **Start with Phase 1:** `01_Phase1_Research_Strategy/`
2. **Follow sequential order:** Complete each phase before moving to next
3. **Document everything:** Use provided templates and track progress
4. **Validate quality:** Use checklists at each phase completion

## 📊 Methodology Overview

### Phase 1: Research & Strategy (Weeks 1-2)
**AI-Accelerated Discovery**
- Stakeholder interviews across 4 government levels
- Technical audit and analysis
- Cross-stakeholder synthesis
- Technical requirements development
- Information architecture design
- User journey mapping

**Deliverables:**
- Stakeholder synthesis and priority alignment
- Comprehensive technical requirements
- Citizen-centered information architecture
- Detailed user journey maps for all user types

### Phase 2: Design & Prototyping (Weeks 3-8)
**Government-Compliant Design System**
- Technical environment setup
- Government design system creation
- Core service implementations
- Accessibility compliance (Section 508/WCAG 2.1 AA)
- User testing and validation

### Phase 3: Development & Integration (Weeks 9-24)
**Scalable Implementation**
- Frontend and backend development
- Government system integrations
- Security framework implementation
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

### Phase 4: Documentation & Handoff (Weeks 25-26)
**Knowledge Transfer**
- Technical documentation
- User training materials
- Maintenance procedures
- Case study development

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Time Savings
- **60-75% faster** than traditional discovery methods
- **2-week discovery** vs. 6-8 week traditional approach
- **Standardized process** reduces setup time by 90%

### Quality Improvements
- **Government compliance built-in** from project start
- **Stakeholder alignment** prevents scope changes
