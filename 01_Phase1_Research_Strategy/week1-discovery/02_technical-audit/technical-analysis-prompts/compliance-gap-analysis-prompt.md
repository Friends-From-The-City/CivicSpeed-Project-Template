**COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Identify ALL applicable regulations - missing requirements create legal risk
2. Prioritize accessibility compliance - this is typically the highest legal risk area
3. Focus on government transparency requirements - these are often overlooked but legally mandated
4. Assess realistic compliance timelines - rushing compliance often leads to incomplete implementation
5. Plan for ongoing compliance management - compliance is not one-time, it's continuous
6. Connect compliance requirements to technical architecture - compliance must be built-in, not bolted-on
7. Ensure stakeholder understanding of compliance obligations and resource requirements
