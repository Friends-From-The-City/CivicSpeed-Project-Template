# Technical Audit - Week 1 Discovery

## üéØ Purpose
Comprehensive technical assessment of current government systems, websites, and infrastructure to inform technical requirements and identify integration constraints, performance bottlenecks, and compliance gaps.

## üìã Overview
The technical audit runs **parallel to stakeholder interviews** during Week 1, providing objective technical data to complement stakeholder perspectives. Results feed into Week 2 strategy development alongside stakeholder synthesis.

## üîç Audit Scope

### Website/Digital Asset Analysis
- **Performance Assessment:** Page load times, Core Web Vitals, mobile optimization
- **SEO & Content Analysis:** Content quality, structure, accessibility compliance
- **Technical Architecture:** Current technology stack, hosting environment, integrations
- **Security Evaluation:** SSL implementation, security headers, vulnerability assessment

### System Integration Analysis  
- **Current Integrations:** Existing system connections and data flows
- **API Documentation:** Available interfaces and integration capabilities
- **Database Assessment:** Data structure, performance, and migration considerations
- **Legacy System Evaluation:** Technical debt and modernization requirements

### Compliance & Accessibility Audit
- **Section 508 Compliance:** Current accessibility standard adherence
- **WCAG 2.1 Assessment:** Detailed accessibility gap analysis
- **Security Framework Review:** NIST, FedRAMP, and government security compliance
- **Data Protection Assessment:** Privacy policies, data handling, and protection measures

## üõ†Ô∏è Audit Tools & Process

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Audit Challenges
**Limited System Access:** Work with IT stakeholders to gain appropriate access levels
**Legacy System Documentation:** Focus on interface analysis and observable behavior
**Security Restrictions:** Use external analysis tools and coordinate with security team
**Large Site Complexity:** Prioritize critical user paths and high-traffic pages

### Quality Assurance
**Data Validation:** Cross-reference audit findings with stakeholder feedback
**Completeness Check:** Ensure all critical systems and integrations covered
**Compliance Focus:** Prioritize government-specific requirements and standards
**Performance Reality:** Validate performance issues with real user scenarios

## üéØ Best Practices

### Audit Efficiency
- **Start Early:** Begin audit setup while stakeholder interviews are being scheduled
- **Parallel Processing:** Run multiple audit tools simultaneously
- **Stakeholder Coordination:** Involve technical stakeholders in audit planning
- **Documentation Focus:** Maintain detailed records for future reference

### Government Context
- **Security Sensitivity:** Coordinate with IT security team before running scans
- **Compliance Priority:** Focus on government-specific requirements (Section 508, NIST)
- **Public Access:** Consider public-facing vs. internal system differences
- **Vendor Relationships:** Document current vendor capabilities and contracts
