## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Stakeholder Interview Issues
**Problem:** Stakeholders too busy or unavailable  
**Solution:** Emphasize 20-minute commitment, offer multiple time slots, get executive sponsor support

**Problem:** Poor audio quality affecting transcription  
**Solution:** Test all equipment beforehand, use backup recording, conduct calls from quiet environments

**Problem:** Stakeholders giving surface-level responses  
**Solution:** Use follow-up questions, ask for specific examples, probe for emotional responses

### AI Analysis Issues
**Problem:** Claude analysis lacks depth or government context  
**Solution:** Use exact prompts provided, include complete stakeholder context, iterate on analysis quality

**Problem:** Transcripts too unclear for effective analysis  
**Solution:** Clean transcripts thoroughly, add speaker labels, correct obvious errors before analysis

**Problem:** Synthesis misses key conflicts or priorities  
**Solution:** Review individual analyses first, provide complete context to synthesis prompt, validate output
