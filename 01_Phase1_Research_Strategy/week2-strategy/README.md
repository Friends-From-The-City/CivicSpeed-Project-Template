# Week 2: Strategy Development

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Transform Week 1 discoveries into actionable digital strategy through AI-accelerated requirements gathering, information architecture design, and user journey mapping.

## ðŸ“‹ Simple Workflow

### Days 6-7: Technical Requirements Development
1. **Load Week 1 outputs** into technical requirements prompt
2. **Claude generates comprehensive specs** with compliance frameworks
3. **Copy sections** into modular files in `ai-outputs/`

### Days 8-9: Information Architecture Design  
1. **Use technical requirements + stakeholder insights** in IA prompt
2. **Claude generates citizen-centered site structure** and navigation strategy
3. **Organize outputs** for user journey integration

### Day 10: User Journey Mapping & Executive Summary
1. **Load IA + technical requirements** into user journey prompt
2. **Claude maps all 5 user types** with optimization opportunities
3. **Feed all Week 2 outputs** into executive summary prompt
4. **Claude generates Phase 1 deliverable package**

## ðŸŽ¯ Your AI-Accelerated Workflow:
```
Week 1 Foundation â†’ Technical Requirements â†’ IA Design â†’ User Journeys â†’ Executive Summary
```

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Deliver:
- **Technical Development Specifications** (government compliance ready)
- **Information Architecture Blueprint** (citizen service optimized)
- **5 User Journey Maps** (covering all government user types)
- **Phase 1 Executive Summary** (client presentation ready)

## âœ… Success Criteria:
- [ ] Technical requirements align with Week 1 stakeholder needs
- [ ] IA structure supports identified citizen services  
- [ ] User journeys address pain points from discovery
- [ ] Executive summary provides clear Phase 2 roadmap

**Timeline:** Days 6-10 of Week 2
