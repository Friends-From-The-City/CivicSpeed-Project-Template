# Technical Requirements Development

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Generate comprehensive technical specifications and compliance frameworks using Week 1 discoveries to create development-ready requirements.

## ðŸ“‹ Simple Workflow

### Day 6: Requirements Analysis Setup
1. **Gather Week 1 inputs:** stakeholder synthesis + technical audit results
2. **Review government compliance checklist** for requirement context
3. **Load all inputs** into technical requirements Claude prompt

### Day 7: AI Analysis & Output Organization
1. **Claude generates comprehensive analysis** with all technical specifications
2. **Copy/paste sections** into modular files in `ai-outputs/`:
   - Technical Architecture â†’ `platform-specifications.md`
   - Compliance Framework â†’ `compliance-requirements.md`  
   - Development Specs â†’ `feature-requirements.md`
   - Quality Assurance â†’ `testing-standards.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Your AI-Accelerated Workflow:
```
Week 1 Outputs â†’ Technical Analysis Prompt â†’ Comprehensive Specs â†’ Modular Files
```

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Deliver:
- **Platform Architecture Document** (technology stack, security, performance)
- **Compliance Framework** (Section 508, WCAG 2.1 AA, NIST standards)  
- **Development Specifications** (feature requirements, integration needs)
- **Quality Assurance Plan** (testing protocols, acceptance criteria)

## âœ… Success Criteria:
- [ ] All Week 1 stakeholder needs addressed in technical specs
- [ ] Government compliance requirements fully integrated
- [ ] Development team can begin work from specifications
- [ ] IA and user journey teams have technical foundation

**Timeline:** Days 6-7 of Week 2
