- [ ] **Search functionality** for public information access planned

### **4. Performance and Reliability Standards**
**Government Service Delivery:**
- [ ] **Uptime requirements** (typically 99.9% for government services) specified
- [ ] **Load handling** for peak government service periods planned
- [ ] **Disaster recovery** and business continuity requirements integrated
- [ ] **Mobile performance** standards (government mobile-first policies) specified

**Citizen Service Standards:**
- [ ] **Page load speed** requirements (<3 seconds for government services) specified
- [ ] **Form completion** accessibility and efficiency requirements planned
- [ ] **Error handling** and user support capabilities integrated
- [ ] **Service status** transparency and communication features specified

## üèõÔ∏è Jurisdiction-Specific Compliance Areas

### **Federal Agency Requirements:**
- [ ] **FedRAMP** cloud security requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] **Section 508** federal accessibility standards
- [ ] **FISMA** information security requirements
- [ ] **Privacy Act** data protection requirements

### **State Government Requirements:**
- [ ] **State accessibility laws** (may exceed federal requirements)
- [ ] **State security frameworks** and data protection standards
- [ ] **State transparency laws** and open records requirements
- [ ] **State procurement** and technology standards

### **Local Government Requirements:**
- [ ] **Municipal accessibility ordinances** and standards
- [ ] **Local transparency requirements** and public meeting laws
- [ ] **Regional security standards** and data sharing agreements
- [ ] **Local emergency protocols** and crisis communication requirements

## ‚úÖ Technical Requirements Validation Checklist

### **During Claude Analysis - Ensure Coverage Of:**
- [ ] **All applicable compliance frameworks** from jurisdiction analysis
- [ ] **Specific accessibility requirements** beyond basic WCAG compliance
- [ ] **Security requirements** appropriate for government data sensitivity
- [ ] **Performance standards** meeting citizen service delivery expectations
- [ ] **Integration requirements** with existing government systems
- [ ] **Emergency protocols** and crisis service delivery capabilities

### **Post-Analysis Validation - Confirm:**
- [ ] **Technical specifications** address all identified compliance gaps
- [ ] **Implementation timeline** realistic for government approval processes
- [ ] **Resource requirements** appropriate for government budget cycles
- [ ] **Risk mitigation** strategies address compliance and security concerns
- [ ] **Quality assurance** plan includes compliance testing and validation
- [ ] **Documentation requirements** meet government standards and approval needs

## üöÄ Integration with Week 2 Workflow

### **Day 6 Usage:**
- **Review this checklist** before loading inputs into technical requirements prompt
- **Validate agency-specific** compliance requirements are documented
- **Ensure Week 1 compliance gaps** are included in analysis inputs

### **Day 7 Usage:**
- **Cross-reference Claude outputs** against this checklist
- **Validate compliance coverage** in technical specifications
- **Confirm quality assurance** includes compliance testing requirements

### **Handoff to IA and User Journey:**
- **Compliance requirements** documented for IA accessibility integration
