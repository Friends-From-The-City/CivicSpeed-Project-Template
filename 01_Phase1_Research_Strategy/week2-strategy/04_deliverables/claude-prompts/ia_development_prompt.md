# Information Architecture Development Prompt

## üéØ Context & Purpose
You are developing a comprehensive information architecture for a government digital transformation project. Use Week 1 stakeholder discoveries and technical requirements to create citizen-centered site structure that prioritizes service delivery efficiency and accessibility compliance.

## üìã Required Input Documents
**Load these documents before proceeding:**
1. **Week 1 Stakeholder Synthesis** (citizen needs, pain points, service priorities)
2. **Technical Requirements Analysis** (platform capabilities, compliance frameworks)
3. **Current Site Technical Audit** (existing structure, performance issues)
4. **Government Compliance Checklist** (accessibility, security requirements)

## üîç Analysis Framework

### **Step 1: Citizen Service Mapping**
Analyze stakeholder insights to identify:
- **Primary citizen services** and their usage frequency
- **Service groupings** that match citizen mental models
- **Cross-departmental touchpoints** requiring coordination
- **Emergency vs. routine service** access patterns

### **Step 2: Content Hierarchy Development**
Create logical content organization based on:
- **Citizen task completion workflows** (from discovery phase)
- **Government service delivery structure** (departmental alignment)
- **Accessibility navigation requirements** (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- **Mobile-first service access** patterns

### **Step 3: Navigation Strategy Design**
Develop navigation that supports:
- **Multi-user type access** (citizens, businesses, staff, visitors)
- **Service discovery efficiency** (reduce clicks to key services)
- **Accessibility compliance** (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- **Responsive design requirements** (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### **Step 4: Integration Planning**
Plan for technical integration:
- **Existing system compatibility** (legacy system constraints)
- **Future service expansion** (scalable structure)
- **Cross-platform consistency** (unified citizen experience)
- **Performance optimization** (fast service access)

## üìä Deliverable Templates

### **Site Map & Content Hierarchy**
```
# Government Portal Information Architecture

## Level 1: Primary Navigation
- [Service Category] (based on citizen mental models)
  - Level 2: Service Subcategories
    - Level 3: Specific Services/Forms
    - Level 3: Support Resources

## Service Integration Points
- Cross-departmental touchpoints
- Shared authentication requirements
- Data integration needs

## Accessibility Features
- Skip navigation options
- Alternative navigation paths
- Screen reader optimization
```

### **Navigation Strategy Document**
```
# Citizen-Centered Navigation Strategy

## Primary User Paths
[For each user type identified in Week 1]
- Entry points and expected workflows
- Service completion pathways
- Support and help access

## Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly interface design
- Simplified mobile navigation
- Progressive disclosure strategy

## Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA navigation requirements
- Keyboard-only navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
```

### **Content Organization Plan**
```
# Content Strategy & Organization

## Service Categorization
- Logical groupings based on citizen needs
- Clear service descriptions and expectations
- Multi-language content strategy

## Content Governance
- Update responsibility by department
- Content quality standards
- User feedback integration process
```

## üéØ Government-Specific Requirements

### **Compliance Integration:**
- **Section 508 Accessibility:** Ensure all navigation meets federal accessibility standards
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Standards:** Implement comprehensive accessibility features
- **Security Requirements:** Plan for secure service delivery and data protection
- **Performance Standards:** Design for government network constraints and citizen device diversity

### **Citizen Service Priorities:**
- **Service Discovery:** Citizens can find services intuitively without prior knowledge
- **Task Completion:** Clear pathways from service discovery to completion
- **Multi-Channel Support:** Consistent experience across digital and physical touchpoints
- **Emergency Access:** Priority access for urgent services and crisis situations

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance Checklist

### **Stakeholder Alignment Verification:**
- [ ] IA structure reflects citizen mental models from Week 1 interviews
- [ ] Service priorities align with stakeholder-identified needs
- [ ] Navigation supports all user types discovered in stakeholder analysis
- [ ] Content organization addresses pain points identified in discovery

### **Technical Feasibility Confirmation:**
- [ ] IA structure compatible with technical requirements and platform capabilities
- [ ] Navigation design supports responsive/mobile requirements
- [ ] Integration points align with existing system constraints
- [ ] Performance requirements addressed in structure design

### **Accessibility Compliance Verification:**
- [ ] All navigation elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional throughout structure
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility confirmed for all content organization
- [ ] Alternative access methods provided for complex interactions

### **Government Service Delivery Optimization:**
- [ ] Service discovery time minimized for citizen priority tasks
- [ ] Cross-departmental coordination points clearly defined
- [ ] Emergency service access prioritized and clearly marked
- [ ] Content governance structure supports ongoing service delivery

## üöÄ Output Generation Instructions
