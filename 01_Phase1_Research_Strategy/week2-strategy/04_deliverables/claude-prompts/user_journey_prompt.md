# User Journey Mapping Development Prompt

## üéØ Context & Purpose
You are creating comprehensive user journey maps for 5 distinct government user types. Use Week 1 stakeholder discoveries, technical requirements, and IA structure to map complete citizen service experiences that identify optimization opportunities and pain point solutions.

## üìã Required Input Documents
**Load these documents before proceeding:**
1. **Week 1 Stakeholder Interview Synthesis** (user behaviors, pain points, service expectations)
2. **Technical Requirements Analysis** (platform capabilities, integration constraints)
3. **Information Architecture Blueprint** (site structure, navigation strategy)
4. **Current User Experience Audit** (existing journey friction points)

## üîç Journey Mapping Framework

### **Step 1: User Context Analysis**
For each user type, analyze:
- **Service motivations and goals** (what drives them to government services)
- **Digital literacy levels** (technology comfort and constraints)
- **Access method preferences** (mobile, desktop, in-person backup needs)
- **Time sensitivity factors** (routine vs. urgent service needs)

### **Step 2: Touchpoint Identification**
Map all interaction points:
- **Digital touchpoints** (website, forms, communication channels)
- **Human touchpoints** (support, verification, assistance needs)
- **System integration points** (data sharing, verification processes)
- **External dependency points** (third-party services, document requirements)

### **Step 3: Pain Point & Opportunity Analysis**
Identify and prioritize:
- **High-friction moments** (where users struggle or abandon tasks)
- **Accessibility barriers** (compliance gaps, usability issues)
- **Efficiency opportunities** (automation, streamlining potential)
- **Service delivery improvements** (faster resolution, clearer communication)

### **Step 4: Solution Integration Planning**
Connect journey improvements to:
- **IA structure optimization** (navigation improvements, content organization)
- **Technical capability enhancement** (new features, integration opportunities)
- **Process improvement opportunities** (workflow optimization, automation)
